## What is a Google Maps scraper?
Google Maps Scraper is a Python script that lets you scrape Google Maps and extract business details like names, ratings, reviews, and service options. Itâ€™s built for developers and data teams who need scalable local data collection with proxy rotation support to bypass rate limits and avoid blocks.

## Features
- **Rotating proxy support**. Bypass IP bans and rate limits with residential proxies.

- **Business data extraction**. Extract names, ratings, reviews, and service options.

- **Location targeting**. Scrape Google Maps results for any city or region.

- **Dynamic content handling**. Use Selenium to load JavaScript-rendered pages.

- **HTML parsing**. Clean and structure scraped data with [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

- **CSV export**. Save extracted business data to a local CSV file.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**. Run the following command in your terminal to install and navigate to the project folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/Decodo/google-maps-scraper.git
cd google-maps-scraper
```
2. **Install dependencies**. Make sure you have [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, then run:
```
pip install selenium selenium-wire webdriver-manager beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage examples
1. **Run the scraper with proxy rotation**. This script is ready to run out of the box. Just plug in your [proxy credentials](https://dashboard.decodo.com/) and update file paths:
```
python google-maps-scraper.py
```
By default, it will:

- Visit Google Maps with the query "falafel in London"
- Accept cookies
- Scroll to load more results
- Parse the page
- Save business data to a local CSV file
2. **Customize the search query**. Run your own query by updating this line in the script:
```
url = "https://www.google.com/maps/search/falafel+in+london/"
```
